Description: An implementation of tools for design of attribute 
  variable sampling interval cumulative sum chart. 
  It currently provides information for monitoring of mean increase such as 
  average number of sample to signal, average time to signal,
  a matrix of transient probabilities, suitable control limits when the data are
  (zero inflated) Poisson/binomial distribution. 
  Functions in the tools can be easily applied to other count processes.
  Also, tools might be extended to more complicated cumulative sum control chart.
  We leave these issues as our perpetual work.
