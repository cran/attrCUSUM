# attrCUSUM

attrCUSUM is tools for statistical design of attribute VSI CUSUM chart.
It currently provides informations on monitoring of mean increase including

* Average number of sample to signal (ANSS).
* Computation of suitable control limits for 
fixed sampling interval (FSI) scheme.
* Computation of the longer sampling interval for 
variable sampling interval (VSI) scheme.
* Average time to signal (ATS).
* A matrix of transition probabilities for Markov chain approach.

These tools might be extended to more complicated CUSUM control chart and 
we leave these issues as our future works.
